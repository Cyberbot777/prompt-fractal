# ðŸŒŒ Prompt Fractal

**Recursive Prompt Optimization Agent â€” Refines, Simplifies, and Self-Evolves Prompts through Iterative LLM Self-Prompting Loops**

---

## Overview

**Prompt Fractal** is an advanced AI agent designed to automatically optimize, clarify, and refine prompts for large language models (LLMs) using recursive, self-referential prompting loops.

It performs prompt self-improvement by:
- Analyzing a given promptâ€™s clarity, length, and effectiveness.
- Suggesting targeted improvements.
- Iteratively rewriting the prompt for maximum precision and minimal ambiguity.
- Saving its learning history to a memory system, allowing for continual evolution and optimization over time.

This project explores **recursive prompting** â€” where an LLM effectively teaches itself to write better prompts via structured self-review and refinement cycles.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Self-Improvement:**  
  Multi-pass prompt refinement via LLM-driven analysis and rewriting.

- **Prompt Simplification:**  
  Automatically removes unnecessary complexity, jargon, and vague phrasing.

- **Auto-Chaining Detection (Planned):**  
  Identifies when prompts should be split into smaller subtasks and suggests chaining.

- **Memory & Semantic Recall (Planned):**  
  Uses PostgreSQL + pgvector for semantic memory of prior prompt refinements.

- **Modular Design:**  
  Built for extensibility with LangChain as the core framework for agent logic and memory handling.

## Why Prompt Fractal?

Most prompts written by humans â€” even advanced users â€” suffer from:
- Overcomplexity
- Ambiguity
- Ineffective or redundant instructions
- Hallucination-prone structures

While prompt chaining and few-shot prompting help, **Prompt Fractal** takes a different approach:
- It **automatically rewrites prompts** to be shorter, clearer, and more effective, using its own recursive loops.
- It can optionally recommend chaining when appropriate, offering both prompt optimization and structural decomposition.

This approach allows LLM agents to *self-train their prompting ability* over time â€” minimizing manual engineering.

## Core Workflow

```
flowchart TD
  A[User provides raw prompt] --> B[Agent analyzes prompt]
  B --> C[Agent rewrites prompt for clarity & brevity]
  C --> D[Test improved prompt (optional)] 
  D --> E{Max iterations reached?}
  E -- No --> B
  E -- Yes --> F[Save prompt & results to memory]
```
