# 🌌 Prompt Fractal

**Recursive Prompt Optimization Project — Featuring Iris, the Self-Reflective Prompt Agent**

---

## Overview

**Prompt Fractal** is an AI project designed to automatically optimize, clarify, and refine prompts for large language models (LLMs) through recursive, self-referential prompting loops.

At its core is **Iris** — the self-reflective prompt optimization agent within Prompt Fractal.

Iris performs prompt self-improvement by:
- Analyzing prompts for clarity, length, and effectiveness.
- Providing detailed reviews with a clarity rating and specific improvement suggestions.
- Automatically rewriting prompts to improve focus, reduce ambiguity, and increase precision.
- Logging each review and rewrite cycle with timestamps for future analysis.

This project explores **recursive prompting** — where an LLM effectively teaches itself to write better prompts through structured self-review and refinement cycles.

## Key Features

- **Self-Reflective Prompt Review:**  
  Iris evaluates prompts for clarity, complexity, and ambiguity, providing detailed analysis.

- **Automatic Prompt Rewriting:**  
  Iris generates fully rewritten versions of prompts based on its review feedback.

- **Structured Test Logging:**  
  All tests are logged automatically with timestamps and phase labels for future reference.

- **Modular, Extensible Design:**  
  Built with scalability in mind to enable multi-phase refinement and future integrations.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Python 3.11** — Core programming language.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo** — Current LLM used for analysis and rewriting.
- **Docker** — Containerization for a reproducible, isolated environment.
- **dotenv** — Secure API key management.

### Frontend (Planned)
- **React (Vite)** — Fast frontend framework for interactive UI.
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS for sleek, dark-themed styling.
- **Framer Motion** — Smooth animations and transitions.
- **React Markdown** — For clean LLM output rendering.

### Database (Planned)
- **PostgreSQL** — Persistent memory storage for prompt histories.
- **pgvector** — Semantic vector search extension for PostgreSQL (future memory recall).

### DevOps / Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose** (Planned) — For orchestrating multi-service setups.

## Docker Usage

Prompt Fractal runs fully inside Docker.

### Build the Docker Image:
```bash
docker build -t prompt-fractal-backend ./backend
```

### Run the Iris Agent:
```bash
docker run --rm --env-file ./backend/.env prompt-fractal-backend
```

Docker ensures that Iris operates in a clean, reproducible environment without requiring local virtual environments.

## Roadmap

### **Phase 1:** Prompt Review + Rewriting Agent (Active)
- [x] Single-pass prompt review and rewriting.
- [x] Test logging with timestamps and phase tracking.
- [ ] Multi-pass refinement loop (3–5 iterations).
- [ ] Initial memory schema (PostgreSQL).

### **Phase 2:** Auto-Chaining Recommender
- [ ] Detect multi-goal prompts and suggest chaining.
- [ ] Auto-generate optimized sub-prompts for subtasks.

### **Phase 3:** Semantic Memory + Retrieval
- [ ] Integrate pgvector for semantic memory search.
- [ ] Enable recall and knowledge transfer between similar prompts.

### **Phase 4:** PromptPilot Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Connect Prompt Fractal to PromptPilot as an advanced lab feature.
