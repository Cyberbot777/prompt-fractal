=== Phase 1 — Review Test — 2025-07-04 07:34:45 ===

Original Prompt:
Explain stuff about AI but like go deep but also make it simple but not too simple and also give examples and maybe something else too idk.

Review Output:
Clarity rating: 3

Specific issues found:
1. The prompt is overly vague and lacks clear direction or focus.
2. It includes contradictory instructions, such as "go deep but also make it simple."
3. Ambiguous phrases like "explain stuff about AI" and "maybe something else too idk" make it unclear what exactly is required.

Suggestions for improving the prompt:
1. Define the specific aspects of AI to be explained (e.g., applications, challenges, techniques).
2. Clarify the depth of explanation desired - whether it should be technical or conceptual.
3. Provide examples of what type of examples are expected.
4. Remove vague expressions like "maybe something else too idk" and set clear expectations.

Fully rewritten prompt:
"Please provide an in-depth explanation of the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, highlighting both its benefits and challenges. Include at least two real-world examples of how AI is currently being used in the medical field. Ensure the explanation strikes a balance between technical accuracy and accessibility for a general audience."
