# Iris Agent - Empirical Validation Test for Top-N Memory Retrieval
# ---------------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
Verify that Iris successfully retrieves and utilizes top-N most similar prompts from vector memory during refinement.

This test uses a completely unrelated test prompt to the current memory (which contains variations of "Why is the sky blue?").
We'll seed a few tide-related prompts into memory, then verify that Iris recalls and uses them during refinement.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Clear Memory (optional)
  - This step is only if you want a clean test environment.
  - If skipping, make sure your vector DB has *no tide-related prompts* before starting.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Seed Memory with Tide-Related Prompts
Manually add the following prompts by inserting and running these in your `iris_agent.py` (inside `if __name__ == "__main__":`):

    save_prompt_to_memory("What causes ocean tides? Explain how the moon and sun affect the rise and fall of sea levels.")
    save_prompt_to_memory("Describe the gravitational effects of the moon on ocean tides. Why do we have high and low tides?")
    save_prompt_to_memory("How do lunar and solar positions influence the Earth's tides? Provide a general explanation suitable for middle school students.")

Run the file using:
    docker-compose exec backend python iris_agent.py

Check console to confirm:
    Memory saved successfully: ...

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Run the Test Prompt

Replace the test prompt in your entry point with:

    test_prompt = "What causes the tides to move in and out every day?"

Then run again using:
    docker-compose exec backend python iris_agent.py

Expected Output:
  - Top 3 memory matches will include your 3 tide prompts.
  - Iris will rewrite your prompt using words like "gravitational", "moon", "lunar", "ocean", etc.
  - This confirms N-memory is influencing the rewrite behavior.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Save and Submit Results

After running the above:
- Copy the full terminal output into a log file.
- Attach this test file and log to your project repo for empirical validation.

End of Test.

3. The level of detail or depth of analysis expected is not explicitly stated.

Suggestions for improving the prompt:
1. Remove the excessive background information and focus on the essential requirements.
2. Specify distinct aspects for comparison, such as tidal range, frequency, and ecosystem impacts.       
3. Clearly outline the expected depth of analysis to guide the response.

Rewritten prompt:
Compare the tidal characteristics of open ocean regions to those of enclosed bays and estuaries, emphasizing factors like tidal range, frequency, and ecosystem impacts. Analyze the differences in these tidal behaviors and provide a detailed assessment to enhance understanding of ocean dynamics in various coastal settings. Your response should explore the unique features of tidal patterns in each environment and their implications. Strive for a comprehensive examination of the distinct traits of open ocean versus enclosed bay/estuary tides.
