=== CASE STUDY: Multi-Pass Auto-Stop Behavior in Recursive Agent ===

**Date:** July 4, 2025  
**Experiment:** Iris Phase 2 — Multi-Pass Refinement with Auto-Stop Logic

---

## Overview

This case study explores the effectiveness of Iris’s Phase 2 Auto-Stop mechanism during recursive prompt refinement. The auto-stop feature is designed to halt the refinement loop once a stable, high clarity score is achieved in consecutive passes.

**Key Insight:**  
Auto-stop prevents unnecessary over-refinement once a prompt reaches high clarity (≥ 9) consistently.

## Test Summary

### Auto-Stop Test Case:
**Prompt:**  
"Describe how to apply for a driver’s license."

- **Target:** Simple, short prompt likely to converge quickly.
- **Auto-Stop Threshold:** Stability of ≥9 clarity for 2 consecutive passes.
- **Pass Limit:** 5

### Key Results:
- Pass 1 Score: 7  
- Pass 2 Score: 9  
- Pass 3 Score: 10  
- Auto-Stop Triggered Successfully at Pass 3.

### Debug Logs (Excerpt):
[Debug] Current score: 7, Previous score: None
[Debug] Current score: 9, Previous score: 7
[Debug] Current score: 10, Previous score: 9
Auto-stop triggered at Pass 3 — Stable Clarity 10

## Analysis

- **Success:** Auto-stop correctly detected stabilization and prevented further refinement.
- **Behavior:** The agent naturally stopped refining when the prompt reached high clarity.
- **Observation:** Earlier tests showed cases where prompts kept fluctuating, indicating this feature is most useful for straightforward prompts.

---

## Lessons Learned:
- Auto-stop prevents unnecessary cycles, improving speed and stability.
- Useful for production scenarios where over-refinement may reduce prompt quality.

---

## Future Plans:
- Consider exposing auto-stop threshold as a user-configurable setting.
- Track whether frequent stop/start triggers vary across different prompt domains.
