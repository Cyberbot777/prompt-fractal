=== Phase 2 — Multi-Pass Refinement Test — 2025-07-09 19:22:48 UTC ===

=== Original Messy Prompt (Starting Point) ===
So I’ve been thinking about how businesses could improve, especially in terms of how people work together, or sometimes individually. There’s also motivation, which can be tricky, and maybe leadership plays a role here too. Plus, how people get along in teams or the way tasks are handled, or even how the company runs its processes — all that could matter. Can you explain all of this, like what really helps employees do better at work or makes the company run more effectively overall?
