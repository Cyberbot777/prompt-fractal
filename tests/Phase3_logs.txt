=== Top 3 Memory Matches ===
1. Distance: 0.3211
Why does the sky appear blue during the day? Describe simply how light interacts with air molecules to create the sky's blue hue. Explain how shorter wavelengths of sunlight scatter in the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in the blue sky we see. Aim for clarity and accessibility in your explanation, avoiding overly technical terms.

2. Distance: 0.3598
Why does the sky appear blue during the daytime? Explain the scientific phenomenon behind this color effect, covering aspects such as Rayleigh scattering and how sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. Tailor your explanation to be accessible to a general audience intrigued by everyday mysteries. Understanding this can deepen your appreciation of the natural world's beauty and wonder by unraveling the science behind our blue skies. This understanding can also serve as a gateway to appreciating other atmospheric phenomena and can spark curiosity about the interaction between light and matter in our environment.

3. Distance: 0.3898
Offer a detailed scientific explanation clarifying the reason behind the blue coloration of the sky during daylight hours, emphasizing the role of Rayleigh scattering in Earth's atmosphere. The explanation should include a step-by-step description of the scientific process responsible for this atmospheric phenomenon.

=== Pass 1 ===
Clarity Rating: 7

Specific Issues:
1. The prompt is lacking necessary context and details. It does not specify the intended scope or depth of the explanation required.
2. The prompt is too short and simplistic, potentially leading to surface-level responses without much depth.
3. Ambiguity: It is unclear whether the answer should be based on scientific, cultural, or mystical perspectives.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide more context or specify the desired level of detail in the explanation.
2. Clarify if a specific approach is required (scientific, cultural, etc.).
3. Consider phrasing the prompt in a way that encourages a thorough and substantive response.       

Rewritten Prompt:
"Why does the sky appear blue during the day? Provide a detailed scientific explanation for the phenomenon, including factors such as Rayleigh scattering and the interaction of sunlight with Earth's atmosphere."
