Final Evaluation Report: Iris Recursive Prompt Agent
Multi-Prompt Validation Summary — Phase 2 Testing

Overview
This test series evaluated Iris, a recursive prompt optimization agent, across five distinct prompt categories:
1. Ambiguous Prompts
2. Complex Prompts
3. Long Prompts
4. Messy Prompts
5. Short Prompts

The primary goal was to assess Iris’s ability to:
- Improve prompt clarity.
- Refine vague or poorly structured prompts.
- Maintain stability across multi-pass recursive refinement.
- Auto-stop reliably when high clarity is achieved.

Key Findings Across All Tests

Strengths
- High Clarity Gains: Iris consistently improved prompt clarity, even on vague or disorganized prompts.
- Recursive Refinement Works: Iris's iterative process successfully refined prompts in nearly every case.
- Effective Auto-Stop (Post Tuning): Whole-number clarity ratings improved auto-stop reliability in later tests.
- Professional Tone: Final outputs were consistently professional and well-structured.

Limitations & Challenges
- Stability Issues on Messy or Multi-Goal Prompts:
  Iris struggled to maintain focus on single objectives when faced with prompts containing overlapping topics (e.g., productivity + leadership + customer satisfaction). This led to:
  - Score oscillations.
  - Shifts in focus mid-refinement.
  - Repeated "goal hopping" between passes.
- Over-Refinement Risk on Short Prompts:
  On simple prompts, Iris sometimes added excessive complexity during later passes — reducing clarity after an initially good result.
- Lack of Long-Term Memory or Task Anchoring:
  Iris cannot “remember” prior refinements or lock onto specific goals over multiple passes, which limits her ability to:
  - Resolve multi-topic prompts cleanly.
  - Recognize diminishing returns in later refinements.

Performance by Prompt Type
Prompt Type | Stability | Effectiveness | Key Risk
------------|-----------|---------------|---------
Ambiguous   | Moderate  | High          | Tends to over-elaborate without memory.
Complex     | High      | High          | Stable but sometimes verbose.
Long        | Very High | Very High     | Occasional over-refinement risk.
Messy       | Low–Medium| Medium–High   | Unstable focus, goal shifting, memory needed.
Short       | Medium    | High          | Risks over-complicating in later passes.

Technical Insights
1. Auto-Stop & Clarity Ratings
- Whole-number clarity ratings dramatically improved auto-stop success rates.
- Stable stopping was achieved when Iris consistently reached a clarity score ≥9.
- Tests confirmed that refining clarity ratings alone (without system code changes) can greatly stabilize refinement.

2. Goal Drift & Stability
- Iris is highly sensitive to vague or multi-focus prompts.
- Without memory, she may:
  - Shift goals between passes.
  - Reinvent different interpretations of the same prompt.
- This behavior is natural in recursive agents without context recall.

3. Over-Refinement Behavior
- Iris tends to over-elaborate on short prompts once clarity exceeds a certain point.
- This happens due to lack of a mechanism for detecting "sufficient detail."

Recommendations & Next Steps
Immediate (Phase 2.5)
- Integrate Memory-Assisted Refinement:
  Enable Iris to remember prior successful refinements to:
  - Reduce oscillation in messy prompts.
  - Avoid goal drift in multi-pass processes.
  - Enhance stability by anchoring to earlier high-clarity passes.

Short-Term (Phase 3)
- Chain-of-Thought Detection & Task Decomposition:
  Allow Iris to automatically detect and segment multi-goal prompts before refinement begins.
  - This will resolve current limitations on messy/multi-topic prompts.
  - It will enable Iris to suggest sub-prompts or prompt chaining where appropriate.

Long-Term Enhancements
- Dynamic Stopping Criteria:
  Develop adaptive stopping thresholds based on:
  - Pass-to-pass clarity changes.
  - Detected over-elaboration.
- User Feedback Loop:
  Optionally allow manual review or intervention in future UI versions.

Final Assessment
Iris demonstrates strong core competence as a recursive refinement agent:
- She can clarify most prompts with high effectiveness.
- Her recursive review strategy works well for long, complex, and ambiguous prompts.
- Auto-stop is reliable when clarity ratings are well-structured.

However, Iris’s lack of memory and task decomposition limits her ability to:
- Handle messy, multi-topic prompts with stability.
- Avoid redundant over-refinement on short or simple prompts.

These tests clearly validate your development roadmap:
- Memory must be prioritized next to unlock stable, multi-pass refinement in complex cases.
- Chain-of-Thought detection should follow, enabling Iris to break down multi-goal prompts effectively.
