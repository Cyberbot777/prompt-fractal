=== CASE STUDY: Prompt Tone & User Assumption Shift ===

Date: July 4, 2025
Experiment: Iris Phase 1 Prompt Review Impact on LLM Response Tone and Assumptions

---

## Overview

This case study demonstrates how prompt quality, as evaluated and improved by Iris (Phase 1), can significantly affect the tone, depth, and assumptions of a large language model (LLM) response.

### Key Insight:
Higher-quality prompts, produced by Iris, lead LLMs to assume a more capable, mature user and result in more advanced, respectful, and realistic outputs.

---

## Test Procedure

1. **Original Prompt (Low-Quality):**
Prompt:
> "Explain how to get are carrer as a lwayer but like go deep but also make it simple but not too simple and also give examples and maybe something else too idk."

2. **Iris Analysis:**
- Clarity rating: 3
- Issues:
  - Poor grammar and spelling.
  - Contradictory instructions (deep but simple).
  - Informal and ambiguous phrasing.
- Fully Rewritten Prompt (By Iris):
> "Explain the steps to pursue a career as a lawyer, providing detailed insights while maintaining clarity. Include relevant examples and any additional considerations you find helpful."

## LLM Response Comparison

### Response to Original Prompt (Clarity Rating 3):
- Tone: Extremely simplified, assumes low education.
- Starts with Step 1: Finish High School (implying user may not have completed it).
- Uses overly friendly, overly simplified language.
- Emphasizes basic academic milestones and guidance.

### Response to Iris-Rewritten Prompt (Clarity Rating Improved):
- Tone: Professional and respectful, assumes user is capable.
- Starts with Step 1: Earn a Bachelor's Degree (assuming high school completion).
- Provides advanced legal career steps with depth.
- Offers strategic advice (e.g., law review, internships) and considers long-term career paths.
- Uses formal and technical phrasing, treating the user as an aspiring professional.

---

## Analysis

The comparison reveals that LLMs infer user intent, background, and education level based heavily on prompt clarity, grammar, and tone.

Poor-quality prompts lead the model to:
- Simplify unnecessarily.
- Focus on basic, remedial steps.
- Use less respectful, overly simplistic phrasing.

High-quality prompts lead the model to:
- Assume a more sophisticated user.
- Skip redundant or remedial steps.
- Provide advanced, professional-level guidance.

This demonstrates that **prompt quality directly influences not just the content of LLM responses but also the implicit assumptions about the user’s background and needs.**

---

## Conclusion

Iris’s ability to rewrite prompts into a more professional, clear format materially improves the LLM’s responses in both tone and informational depth.

This insight strongly supports integrating Iris as a practical tool (e.g., “Prompt Tudor” within PromptPilot) to assist users in optimizing their prompts before submission to an LLM.

---

## Future Considerations

- Expand testing to additional domains (medicine, finance, tech) to validate consistency of this effect.
- Explore automatic tone calibration as a future capability for Iris.
- Document additional case studies of tone, depth, and content shift effects.

=== EVIDENCE LOG: LLM Responses to Prompt Variations ===

Date: July 4, 2025
Experiment: Iris Phase 1 — Prompt Review Impact on LLM Response Tone and Assumptions

---

## Test 1: Response to Original Low-Quality Prompt (Clarity Rating 3)
Prompt Used:
"Explain how to get are carrer as a lwayer but like go deep but also make it simple but not too simple and also give examples and maybe something else too idk."

LLM Response:

Absolutely! I’ll guide you step by step — slowly, clearly, and deeply — but in a way that feels approachable. You’ll really understand the process by the end.

How to Become a Lawyer (Deep but Simple Guide)
Step 1: Finish High School (or Equivalent)
You must finish high school or get a GED.
Focus on subjects like English, history, and government—these help your thinking and writing skills.
Example: A student interested in law joins the debate team and takes advanced English classes to improve argumentation skills.

Step 2: Get a Bachelor's Degree (4-Year College Degree)
In the U.S., you must earn a bachelor’s degree before law school.
There is no specific required major—but common ones include:
Political Science, History, English, Philosophy, Business
Tip: Choose a major you enjoy that also sharpens skills like writing, reading, and analysis.
Example: Maya studies Philosophy because she enjoys ethics and debate. She also takes criminal justice electives.

## Test 2: Response to Iris-Rewritten Prompt (Improved Clarity)
Prompt Used:
"Explain the steps to pursue a career as a lawyer, providing detailed insights while maintaining clarity. Include relevant examples and any additional considerations you find helpful."

LLM Response:

Absolutely! Let's walk step by step through how to become a lawyer in the U.S., keeping it clear but deep enough for you to really understand the process.

Step 1: Earn a Bachelor’s Degree
What You Need to Know:
You must have a bachelor's degree before applying to law school.
No specific major is required, but common choices include: Political Science, History, Philosophy, Business, English
Example: Many future lawyers study Political Science to learn about government systems and legal principles.
Key Tip: Focus on critical thinking, writing, and research skills in college. GPA is important for law school admissions.

Step 2: Take the LSAT (Law School Admission Test)
Details about LSAT, preparation tips, and strategic advice for test takers.

Step 3 and Beyond: Application process, law school details, bar exam preparation, specialization opportunities, and ethical considerations.
Provides rich, formal advice and optional advanced resources for aspiring lawyers.
